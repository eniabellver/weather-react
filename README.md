### How to run locally

1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm i` on root directory
3. Create `.env` file manually or run command: `touch .env` on root directory
4. Obtain free API keys from [GeoDB](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/) and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/); then create environmental variables using the name format from `.env.example`
5. Run `npm start` to see app on http://localhost:3000/

### What's left to do? What I will do to improve weather-react:

- Write tests and automate testing using GitHub actions
- Improve styling with a CSS library (tbd), add animations to transitions and dark/light mode
- Make webapp responsive for smaller screens

### Conclusion

I enjoyed working with GeoDB and OpenWeather APIs, I think they're a great learning resource although I was careful not to surpass the requests limit on the free subscriptions.
